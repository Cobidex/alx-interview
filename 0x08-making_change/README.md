# 0x08. Making Change

This is an implementation of a function which determines the fewest nuber of coins needed to meet a given amount

the value of the coin  will always be an integer, and the assumption is that there is an unlimited supply of each coin.

coins are passed in as a list to the function as its first argument while the amount is the second argument

The goal is for the runtime to be in order of O(nlog(n)).
